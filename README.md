### Hi there!👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here's a little bit about me and what I do. 
## I'am Sayali Mane🧑‍🎓 .
Passionate about Data Science | Aspiring Data Analyst | Lifelong Learner

🌱 I recently graduated as a fresher with a degree in Enginnering and have a strong passion 
   for all things data! My goal is to leverage data to gain insights and make informed decisions.
   Data is the raw material of the 21st century. It can be used to solve problems, make decisions, and create new products and services.

  I find data fascinating because it is a way to understand the world around us. Data can be used to answer questions, make predictions, and solve problems. It can also be used to create new products and services.


🔭 I’m currently working on building my skills in data analysis, machine learning,Big data tool and data visualization.

🌟 Here's a glimpse of what I'm up to:

### 💼 Professional Highlights

Completed CDAC (Centre for Development of Advanced Computing,Bengaluru) to solidify my foundation in data science.

Contributed to Omdena by working on Omdena-Milan-C19Crime.

### 🚀 What I'm Excited About
Exploring real-world datasets to uncover hidden patterns and insights.
Improving my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
Networking with fellow data enthusiasts and professionals.

### 🌐 Check Out My Work
Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

⚪[Fraud-bank-account-Detection](https://github.com/ManeSayali/Fraud-bank-account-Detection) 
  - Developed a fraud detection model using ML & DL algorithms on a dataset of 1M instances, including 11K fraud accounts. Overcame imbalanced data challenges with data preprocessing, feature extraction ,analysis sampling & analytics. Implemented algorithms including XGboost , Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and ANN. Deployed the model as a web app for easy use


⚪[Sign Language to Speech Conversion](https://github.com/ManeSayali/Sign-To-Speech-Conversion) 
 - Sign Language to Speech Conversion system built with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow using Deep Learning and Computer Vision concepts in order to communicate using American Sign Language(ASL) based gestures in real-time video streams with differently abled.
                               
Feel free to explore my repositories for more exciting projects!

### 📚 I'm Currently Learning
 1)Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces
 2)Data Analysis with R Programming

### 🎯 My Goals
In the coming months, I plan to:

Land my first role as a data analyst.
Contribute to more open-source projects in the data science community.
Expand my skill set to include Python 🐍, machine learning, and sql.
